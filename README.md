# NLP Project Portfolio

This repository packages five independent NLP projects into a clean, portfolio-style structure.

## Project Index

| Project | Focus | Included Assets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `project-01-analogy-and-embeddings` | Word analogy preprocessing, pretrained embeddings, custom Word2Vec training | Code, dependencies, report |
| `project-02-arithmetic-reasoning` | Arithmetic-focused NLP reasoning pipeline | Project README (source material currently unavailable locally) |
| `project-03-multi-output-learning` | Multi-output / multi-task transformer setup | Dependencies, task specification, project README |
| `project-04-rag-with-langchain` | Hybrid retrieval + reranking + RAG evaluation pipeline | Code, dependencies, eval artifacts, report |
| `project-05-wattbot-term-project` | Final project report package for the WattBot concept | Report, metadata, project README |

## Notes

- Sensitive personal labels were removed from project naming and repository structure.
- A hardcoded model access token in the RAG script was removed and replaced with `HF_TOKEN` environment variable usage.
- Some original files are in macOS `dataless` state in iCloud and are therefore not readable from the current machine session.

## Quick Start

1. Enter the project folder you want to review.
2. Read that folder's `README.md` first.
3. Install dependencies using that project's `requirements.txt` when available.
