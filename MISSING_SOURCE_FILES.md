# Missing Source Files (Current Session)

Some original course artifacts are in macOS iCloud `dataless` state and could not be read in this machine session.

## Affected Portfolio Projects

- `project-02-arithmetic-reasoning`: code/report/data bundle unavailable locally
- `project-03-multi-output-learning`: main code/report unavailable locally
- `project-05-wattbot-term-project`: presentation file unavailable locally (report PDF is included)

## Why This Matters

A `dataless` file can appear in Finder and `ls`, but its actual file content is not locally materialized. Git cannot package or hash those files until they are fully downloaded.
